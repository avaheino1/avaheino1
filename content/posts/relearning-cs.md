# Re-learning CS
One of the main things I will blog about is my adventures into re-learning all the aspects of CS I have completely forgotten since my undergraduate degree.
## How did we get here?
 I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science roughly 7 years ago. I got good grades and all that, but I have to say even then my practical skills were lagging a bit. Sure I knew how to write a convincing essay and how to get good grades from tests, but I had found better things to do in my freetime than practice coding, so my skills were a bit rusty already back then. That was completely my fault, so for any undergrads reading this, the course materials are not enough, you need to practice to get good.
 I also happily skipped most of my networking lectures because I did not happen to like the lecturer, and my knowledge of networking is thus full of holes. 
 After my undergrad I went and got a master's degree in human-computer interaction, and currently I work in academia within HCI. I love HCI and I am happy where I am, but being surrounded by computer scientists day in and day out has made me realize how many holes I have in my CS knowledge. I lived with the "should have listened in those lectures when I had the change" feeling for a couple of years before I finally decided now is the time to re-learn what I have forgotten and learn what I never learned, so welcome to re-learning CS. 
 ## What are we doing now?
 Now we are re-learning CS. I am not a complete beginner, and there are some areas I am more familiar with than others, so we are skipping those. My biggest failures
